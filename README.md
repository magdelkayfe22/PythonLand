# This marks the beginning of my python programming :)

- Classwork is where I built my fundemental knowledge in python.
- Labs is where I usded my fundemental knowledge and implemented into examples of code to build.
- Final Project is my first project, I was assigned to create a rock paper scissors game.
- My second project was a self-indulged project that was inspired from a childhood game called 'Hangman'.
